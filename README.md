Projects from the Deep Learning Foundations nanodegree

## [Project1](https://github.com/rayheberer/udacity-nd101/tree/master/Project1)
A feedforward neural network built using Numpy that makes predictions off of the [UCI Bike Sharing Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset).

## [Project2](https://github.com/rayheberer/udacity-nd101/tree/master/Project2)
A convolutional neural network built using Tensorflow that classifies images from the [CIFAR-10 Dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html).

## [Project3](https://github.com/rayheberer/udacity-nd101/tree/master/Project3)
A recurrent neural network built using Tensorflow that generates Simpsons scripts on the word-level.

## [Project4](https://github.com/rayheberer/udacity-nd101/tree/master/Project4)
A sequence-to-sequence RNN built using Tensorflow that translates from English to French using a small language corpus provided by [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/).

## [Project5](https://github.com/rayheberer/udacity-nd101/tree/master/Project5)
A GAN built using Tensorflow that generate faces similar to those in the [CelebA Dataset](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html).
